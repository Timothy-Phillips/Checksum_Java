# Checksum_Java
This is a 8-Bit, 16-Bit and 32-Bit checksum calculator, that I created in my "Security in Computing" (CIS 3360) class. It takes two command line arguments, the file that the checksum will be calculated from and the size of the checksum (8, 16 and 32 Bits). The source file must be in the same directory as "checksum.class".

Both the compiled "checksum.class" and the source "checksum.java" are included. The seven test files are included as well as their corresponding 21 expected outputs.
